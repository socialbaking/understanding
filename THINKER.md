# Thinker

This document shows the initial thinking for this project, and expansion on these thoughts

The document can be provided to ChatGPT or similar models, to continue adding the thinker document

## Initial Thought

I am looking to take a document, any document, could be html, markdown, pdf

Get its text content out

Chunk up that text content

Then get answers about each chunk

Then, take those chunks and pass it through again with new questions

I have it where it's generating questions along the way about each chunk, which I am about to feed into the model again.

I'm thinking of doing like a tree of this kind of process

I am wanting to know about any ideas around it that I should think about, or if anyone has any thoughts around how I should interact with ChatGPT or language models around this.

It's like the distance from the document is a more high level summary, but what I am trying to do is find the source of each part of the summary.

After I can take out specific chunks and see how the very distance summary / answer comes out

### Given Steps

1. Document conversion and text extraction: Utilize libraries like Beautiful Soup (for HTML), pdf2text or PyPDF2 (for PDF), and mistune or markdown-it-py (for Markdown) to extract text from various document formats.
2. Text chunking: Break the extracted text into meaningful chunks. You can use sentence tokenization, or you could use more advanced methods like TextRank, which can help you identify the most relevant and informative sentences or paragraphs.
3. Generate questions for each chunk: Use ChatGPT to generate questions based on the text chunks. Make sure the questions are specific and concise to get meaningful answers from the model.
4. Retrieve answers for each question: Pass the generated questions back to ChatGPT and obtain answers. You can store these answers in a tree-like data structure (e.g., using nested dictionaries or custom classes) to keep track of the relationships between chunks, questions, and answers.
5. Iterate and refine: You can repeat steps 3 and 4 for the newly generated answers, creating new questions and obtaining more information from the model. This iterative process will help you get a more in-depth understanding of the text.
6. High-level summary: Utilize the answers generated by ChatGPT to create a high-level summary of the document. You can either use the model's summarization capabilities or develop a custom method to combine the answers into a coherent summary.
7. Source identification: As you've built a tree-like structure, you should be able to trace back the source of each part of the summary by traversing the tree. This can help you understand the origins of each piece of information in the summary.
8. Interaction with ChatGPT: Make sure to monitor the quality of generated questions and answers. You can adjust the model's parameters like temperature and max_tokens to control the creativity and length of the outputs.
9. Error handling: Since ChatGPT's knowledge is limited to information up to September 2021, some answers may be outdated or incomplete. Be prepared to handle such cases by either providing fallback strategies or utilizing other sources to supplement the model's output.

### Additional Thoughts

1. Preprocessing: Before extracting text from the document, you may need to preprocess the document to remove noise, extract relevant metadata, or perform other tasks. For example, you may want to remove stop words, punctuation, or HTML tags.
2. Quality of extracted text: Depending on the source and format of the document, the extracted text may contain errors or missing information. You may need to perform some cleaning or correction to improve the quality of the text.
3. Chunking granularity: You may want to experiment with different chunking granularities to find the optimal size for your use case. Chunking at the sentence level may produce too many small chunks, while chunking at the paragraph level may miss important details.
4. Contextual understanding: ChatGPT's ability to generate questions and answers is limited by its understanding of the context. You may need to provide additional context, such as the document title, author, or keywords, to help the model generate more relevant questions and answers.
5. Fine-tuning: If you have access to a large dataset of similar documents, you may want to consider fine-tuning ChatGPT on that dataset to improve its performance on your specific task.
6. Evaluation: You should also consider how you will evaluate the quality of the generated questions and answers. You may want to use human evaluators to assess the relevance and accuracy of the outputs.
7. Deployment: Finally, you should think about how you will deploy your system, whether as a standalone application, a web service, or a part of a larger system. You may need to consider factors such as scalability, security, and user interface design.
