Psychoactive Substances Act 2013 No 53 (as at 01 July 2022), Public Act â€“ New Zealand Legislation

The article discusses the potential of using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis. AI algorithms can analyze medical images and identify patterns that may indicate the presence of cancer, potentially leading to earlier detection and better outcomes for patients. However, there are challenges to implementing AI in healthcare, including concerns about data privacy and the need for rigorous testing and validation of AI systems. Despite these challenges, many experts believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and treatment in the coming years.
